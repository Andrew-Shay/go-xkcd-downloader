# Go XKCD Downloader
A simple XKCD downloader in Go (golang).  
I created this simple program to help me learn Go.  
Since I am new to Go, this project maybe not be following best practices.

# How it works
Running the program will download all the XKCD comics into the directory "images"
and will stop once an image has already been downloaded.
